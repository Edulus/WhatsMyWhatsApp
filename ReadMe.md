<h3>~ 3 Words to Represent Your WhatsApp Contact Info ~</h3>

WhatsMyWhatsApp is a single page web app that makes it possible to easily and simply share your WhatsApp contact info over audio only channels such as radio shows, telephone calls or verbal only communications.

It does this by allowing users to register three easily remembered words and associate them with their WhatsApp contact info.

Receivers of this info can then use those 3 words to look up the provider's contact information in our directory. They are served the provider's phone number and a QR code which may be scanned for easily saving the provider's info to their contacts list.

<h3>Implementation</h3>

Following the Agile software development methodology, presented here is a non-functional mock-up of the future app using HTML & CSS. Future iterations will deploy Javascript, React, Node, Express and MongoDB to allow for user registration, data storage and real-world utility.
